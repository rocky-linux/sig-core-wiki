So for example. You can have a tag named <code>dist-rocky8-build</code> but it happens to inherit <code>dist-rocky8-updates-build</code>, which will likely have a newer set of packages than the former. Inheritance, in a way, can be considered setting \"dnf priorities\" if you've done that before.

For example, in EL8 if you said <code>dnf install postgresql-server</code>, the package that gets installed is version 10. If a module doesn't have a default set, a <code>dnf install</code> will traditionally not work. To ensure a module package will install without having to enable them and to use the default, you need default information. Here's the postgresql example.</p> <pre><code>---\ndocument: modulemd-defaults\nversion: 1\ndata:\n  module: postgresql\n  stream: 10\n  profiles:\n    9.6: [server]\n    10: [server]\n    12: [server]\n    13: [server]\n...\n</code></pre> <p>Even if a module only has one stream, default module information is still needed to ensure that a package can be installed without enabling the module explicitly.

See the references below for the jinja template that lazybuilder uses to generate this information.</p> <p>As a final note, let's say an update comes in for postgresql and you want to ensure that the old version of postgresql 10 and the updated version of 10 can stay together. This is when the final module data is combined together and then it's added into the repo using <code>modifyrepo_c</code>. Note though, you do not have to have the modulemd-defaults provided again.

All there is left to do is to do a chain build in mock. The kicker is you need to pay attention to the build order that is assigned to each package being built. If a build order isn't assigned, assume that it's group 0 and will be built first. This does not stop 0 being assigned, but just know that <code>buildorder</code> being omitted implies group 0.

For a local build, you'd just put them first in the list. Basically each of these groups have to be done, completed, and available right away for the next package or set of packages. For koji+mbs, they do this automatically since they have a tag/repo that gets updated on each completion and the builds are done in parallel.</p> <p>For mock, a chain build will always have an internal repo that it uses, so each completed package will have a final createrepo done on it before moving on to the next package in the list. It's not parallel like koji, but it's still consistent.</p> <p>Essentially a mock command would look like:</p> <pre><code>mock -r module.cfg \\\n  --chain \\\n  --localrepo /var/lib/mock/modulename \\\n  first.src.rpm \\\n  second.src.rpm \\\n  third.src.rpm\n</code></pre>"},{"location":"rpm/local_module_builds/#making-the-final-yaml-and-repo","title":"Making the final YAML and repo","text":"<p>It's probably wise to have a template to make the module repo data off of.
