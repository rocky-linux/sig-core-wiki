# Release Engineering (SIG/Core) Wiki

## About

The Rocky Linux Release Engineering Team (also known as SIG/Core) dedicates themselves to the development, building, management, production, and release of Rocky Linux. This group combines development and infrastructure in a single cohesive unit of individuals that ultimately make the distribution happen.

The "SIG/Core" reference name is not a strict Special Interest Group (as defined by [the Rocky Linux wiki](https://wiki.rockylinux.org/special_interest_groups/)).

The primary goal (or "interest") is to ensure Rocky Linux is built and released in a complete and functional manner. The secondary goal is to ensure proper collaboration and development of the Peridot build system.

## Mission

Release Engineering strives to ensure a stable distribution is developed, built, tested, and provided to the community from the RESF as a compatible derivative of Red Hat Enterprise Linux. To achieve this goal, some of the things we do are:

* Ensuring a quality and fully compatible release product
* Developing and iterating on the build systems and architecture
* Developing all code in the open
* Setting the technical direction for the build system architecture
* Release of beta and final products to the end users and mirrors
* Release of timely updates to the end users and mirrors

See the [What We Do](what_we_do.md) page for a more detailed explanation of our activities.
