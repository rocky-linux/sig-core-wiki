## About

The Rocky Linux Core Special Interest Group (SIG/Core) dedicates themselves to the development, building, management, production, and release of Rocky Linux for the Enterprise Linux community and the many users around the world.This group is the combination of Rocky Linux Release Engineering team which combines development and infrastructure, where members of this group are members of other Special Interest Groups within the Rocky Linux community, such as SIG/AltArch. Some members can be found in other parts of the Enterprise Linux community as a whole, such as EPEL.

## Mission

SIG/Core strives to ensure a stable distribution is developed, built, tested, and provided to the community from the RESF as a compatible derivative of Red Hat Enterprise Linux. To achieve this goal, some of the things we do are:

* Ensuring a quality and fully compatible release product
* Developing and iterating on the build systems and architecture
* Developing all code in the open
* Setting the technical direction for the build system architecture
* Release of beta and final products to the end users and mirrors
* Release of timely updates to the end users and mirrors

See the [What We Do](what_we_do.md) page for a more detailed explanation of our activities.
