title: What We Do
---

Release Engineering (SIG/Core) was brought together as a combination of varying expertise (development and infrastructure) to try to fill in gaps of knowledge but to also to ensure that the primary goal of having a stable release of Rocky Linux is reached.

Some of the things we do in pursuit of our mission goals:

* Continuous preparation for upcoming changes from upstream (Fedora and CentOS Stream)
* Distribution release and maintenance
* Design and development work to integrate all components together
* Maintenance of the infrastructure used to build and maintain Rocky Linux (such as ansible roles and playbooks)
* Working with the testing team with images and a platform to test
* Providing resources for Special Interest Groups
* Providing assistance and resources for users within the community
