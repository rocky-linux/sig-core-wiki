title: What We Do
---

Release Engineering (SIG/Core) was brought together as a combination of varying expertise (development and infrastructure) to try to fill in gaps of knowledge but to also to ensure that the primary goal of having a stable release of Rocky Linux is reached.

Some of the things we do in pursuit of our mission goals:

* Continuous preparation for upcoming changes from upstream (Fedora and CentOS Stream)
* Distribution release and maintenance
* Design and collaboration for the Peridot build system
* Design and development work to integrate all components together
* Maintenance of the infrastructure used to build and maintain Rocky Linux (such as ansible roles and playbooks)
* Working with the testing team with images and a platform to test
* Providing resources for Special Interest Groups
* Providing assistance and resources for users within the community

"Why the name SIG/Core?"

While not an actual [Special Interest Group](https://wiki.rockylinux.org/special_interest_groups/), the reality is that Release Engineering is ultimately the "core" of Rocky Linux's production. The idea of "SIG/Core" stemmed from the thought that without this group, Rocky Linux would not exist as it is now, so we are "core" to its existence. The other idea was that SIG/Core would eventually branch out to elsewhere. Where this would go, it is uncertain.
