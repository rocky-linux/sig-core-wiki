title: Empanadas SIG yaml Configuration
---

Each file in `empanads/sig/` is a yaml file that contains configuration
items for the distribution release version. The configuration determines the
structure of the SIG repositories synced from Peridot or a given repo.

Note that a release profile (for a major version) is still required for this
sync to work.

See the items below to see which options are mandatory and optional.
